    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p class="intro">Continental Bhanchaa isn't just a restaurant — it's a love letter to comfort food with a continental twist, served in the heart of our hometown.</p>
    <p> We spent months experimenting with recipes, curating the perfect ambiance, and shaping a restaurant that speaks to the soul.</p>
    <p>Continental Bhanchaa officially opened its doors in 2024, and since then, it has been a place of gathering, celebration, and unforgettable taste experiences. Every dish tells a story, every table holds a memory, and every guest becomes a part of our journey.</p>

    <h2>Where Taste Meets Heart</h2>
    <p>
      Born from late-night coffee talks and shared dreams, <strong>Continental Bhanchaa</strong> was envisioned by five close friends who believed food could do more than satisfy hunger — it could spark connection. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing subtle inspiration from cozy urban cafés, we brought together warm interiors, communal tables, and hearty European flavors to offer a home away from home. Whether it's brunch with friends or a solo evening meal, our space is designed to make every guest feel like they belong.
